# Hi, its me Raymond! v3
Thanks for taking the time to visit my github! As a recent master graduate from San Jose State, I'm estatic to show off my skills to be a future engineer in AI-related applications! I know things look a bit bare right now, but I'm constantly adding more to my skill set. I hope you enjoy the progress I made :)
